    <h2>Welcome to FETP Bangladesh – Intermediate</h2>
    <p>
        The Intermediate Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) strengthens public health 
        surveillance, outbreak investigation, and emergency response capacity in Bangladesh.
    </p>

<h2>   What is FETP (Intermediate)? </h2>
<p> The Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) is a competency-based, service-oriented training program designed to strengthen national public health systems by developing skilled field epidemiologists. It follows the “learning by doing” model and is technically supported globally by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
FETP usually has three tiers:
<li> Frontline (Basic) – District-level surveillance officers </li>
<li>Intermediate – Mid-level epidemiologists </li>
<li> Advanced – National-level epidemiologists and leaders </li>
The Intermediate level focuses on:
<li> Applied epidemiology </li>
<li> Biostatistics </li>
<li> Outbreak investigation </li>
<li> Surveillance system evaluation </li>
<li> Public health emergency response </li>
<li> Scientific communication </li>
It is typically a 9–12 month fellowship, combining classroom modules and extensive field placement (≈70–80% fieldwork).
  </p>
